tactic trick where you avoid being ganged up upon if you have priority and higher fighing in two units. then you can double team someone and they can't break you off. 

do we for any reason need to know movement left after unit's conflict is rosolved? what about heroic moves
refactor trapping
put currnet points ammount of screen
